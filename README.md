# Kafka Email Module Consumer

The Kafka Email Module Consumer is a service designed to consume events published on Kafka topics. It listens to events triggered by the Kafka Email Module Producer, processes them, and sends emails to recipient addresses using Java Mail Sender. It is configured with sender's email properties and handles appropriate exceptions during the email sending process.


## Introduction

The Kafka Email Module Consumer functions as a service responsible for consuming events published on Kafka topics generated by the Kafka Email Module Producer. It utilizes Kafka listeners and a consumer group to retrieve events, processes them, and sends emails to the recipient's mail address using Java Mail Sender.

## Features

- Listens to Kafka topics for email events triggered by the producer.
- Processes received events and sends emails using Java Mail Sender.
- Configured with sender's email properties.
- Handles appropriate exceptions during the email sending process.

## Setup and Configuration

### Kafka Listeners and Consumer Group

The consumer is configured to listen to Kafka topics for email events using Kafka listeners within a specified consumer group.

### Java Mail Sender Configuration

The service is configured with sender's email properties for the email sending functionality.

## How It Works

The Kafka Email Module Consumer functions as part of a consumer group, listening to events published on Kafka topics by the producer. Upon receiving an email event, it processes the data and utilizes Java Mail Sender to send emails to the specified recipient address.

## Prerequisites

- Accessible and properly configured Kafka broker with topics created by the Kafka Email Module Producer.
- Properly configured Java environment.
- Internet connectivity to send emails through the configured sender's email properties.

## Usage

1. Ensure the Kafka broker is running and Kafka topics generated by the producer are available.
2. Configure the consumer with appropriate Kafka topic settings and Java Mail Sender properties.
3. Run the Kafka Email Module Consumer service.
4. Monitor logs for event consumption and email sending processes.
5. Handle any exceptions or errors encountered during the email sending process.
